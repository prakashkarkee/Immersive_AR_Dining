## Project Summary

The **Immersive AR Dining Journey** project creates an **augmented reality dining experience** where customers, wearing **AR glasses (e.g., Meta Quest 2)**, can witness the virtual story of their meal — from **raw ingredients to cooking to plating**. Using **Unity with AR Foundation**, **AI-generated 3D animations**, and **AI-based tools** like Kaedim, Spline AI, and Blender plugins, the project overlays animated food transformations directly on the dining table.
The goal is to enhance **transparency, storytelling, and enjoyment**—turning every meal into an interactive culinary journey that showcases Aitofresh’s sustainability and ingredient quality.

## Current Progress

- Meta Quest 2 connection and MR environment are successfully configured.
- AI-based food model generation workflow is defined (Kaedim, Spline AI, Blender).
- Prototype AR scene in Unity can anchor and display 3D dishes on a dining table.
- Upcoming tasks: refine animation transitions, integrate final storytelling scripts, and optimize visual quality.

## Risks and Challenges

- **Technical integration**: Synchronizing AI-generated assets with Unity’s AR pipeline for consistent rendering on Meta Quest 2.
- **Performance optimization**: Maintaining low-poly food models for smooth real-time rendering.
- **Hardware dependency**: Meta Quest MR passthrough limitations (grayscale feed, lighting conditions).
- **Timeline pressure**: Meeting visual fidelity and interaction flow goals before project deadline.
